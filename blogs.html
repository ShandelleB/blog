						<h4 id="blog_5">Tora Bay Sauvignon Blanc</h4>
						<p>April 5, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cyz7eopiwwt1ofe/tora_bay.jpg?raw=1"><br><br>
						<p>This week marked the first week I would be trying a white wine since starting my blog and that had me quite excited. I do love red wine, but it was definitely time for a white. This wine would also be my first ever wine to try from New Zealand.</p>
						<p>Before I even opened the wine I wanted to take note of how gorgeous the bottle’s label was. The dark label really allowed the bright silver of the fish design to pop. It made me think of an island like New Zealand and I hoped to be transported there by my taste buds very soon.</p>
						<p>I felt that I was fairly familiar with Sauvignon Blanc, but since this journey is about discovery, I decided to do a little research anyway. I quickly learned that while Sauvignon Blanc is grown all over, it was originally New Zealand that started making it famous in the 1980s. It is known for it&rsquo;s bright fruitiness and is also sometimes referred to as Sancerre. *</p>
						<p>This wine was from New Zealand and sampled on February 17, 2017. After swirling, I inhaled scents of peach, mango, and then a hint of lime. This transported me straight to island time! Even though I was prepared for a fully juice taste, I was completely surprised by the sensation when I let it swirl around my tongue. It felt almost like I had bitten into a peach! At the same time I was reminded of tasting the honeysuckles that grew wild around the home I grew up in. I was listening to &ldquo;400 Lux&rdquo; by Lorde. Then I tried a bite of Havarti and it really brought out a delightful nutty flavor in the cheese. It was rather a delicious experience.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 3.5. Thinking back, that might have been a little low for this first white, but it is helping to set the standard for similar future wines.</p>

						<h4 id="blog_4">Van Ruiten Electric Red Blend</h4>
						<p>March 29, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kkhs85engu7zms6/electric_red.jpg?raw=1"><br><br>
						<p>This week was back to normal. After New Orleans, I was back to work and back in the swing of things. Which also means, I was back to wine from my Wine Awesomeness box.</p>
						<p>While we were in New Orleans, my husband just so happened to purchase a yellow electric guitar. This worked out perfectly for me, because this week was Electric Red Wine week, so I was excited to display the wine with the new guitar as you can tell from the photo.</p>
						<p>However, even though I was excited about the photo taking, I was not very excited about the wine. This wine was a &ldquo;Red Blend&rdquo; and I have not had much luck with those in the past. They have always seemed <em>too</em> … something. <em>Too</em> acidic or <em>too</em> fruity or <em>too</em> bitter. But, because I made a commitment not only to try a new wine every week, but also to not start off with a prejudice to any, I poured myself a glass and got down to business.</p>
						<p>After a little research into &ldquo;Red Blends,&rdquo; I discovered that more wine than I had ever imagined were, in all reality, red blends. And in California, wines only have to be made of 75&#37; of whatever grape they claim to be on the label. * So I may have been drinking more red blends than I ever thought possible.</p>
						<p>This wine was from Lodi, California and sampled on February 10, 2017. I instantly smelled cherries and it was delightful! For this wine, the song pairing was &ldquo;Light My Fire,&rdquo; by The Doors. This song really got me into more of an electric-type mood for drinking this wine. Woah!! With the first sip of this wine, I was absolutely floored! It was not what I was expecting at all. It had a full body with a delicious dark cherry taste and notes of plum and purple grapes coming through. I paired this wine with Feta cheese that had Mediterranean herbs in it, but this wine could easily stand alone. I also could have done without so many Mediterranean herbs. I resolved in the future to try it with Brie instead.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine another rating of 5.0. I could not believe it. Two weeks in a row, I tried two 5.0 wines! I’m not sure how next week is going to follow that!</p>

						<h4 id="blog_3">Stag&rsquo;s Leap Wine Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon</h4>
						<p>March 22, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0yw966wz3cnzx7p/stags_leap.jpg?raw=1"><br><br>
						<p>This week was an interesting one. It was also an out of the box week, as I will call it from here on out. That means this wine did not come from my wine subscription box, but instead, was a wine that I went out and purchased on my own.</p>
						<p>It was a special week because it was spent in New Orleans, Louisiana. My husband and our dogs traveled there for the Rock and Roll Marathon. It was my husband’s first marathon to participate in and since it was in New Orleans, a city we both enjoy, we decided to stay a few days as well. He requested a celebratory wine to enjoy the evening after the marathon. Since he is a red only type of person, I chose the 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon from Stag&rsquo;s Leap Wine Cellars.</p>
						<p>Stag&rsquo;s Leap is a well-known California vineyard that was established in 1893. Stag&rsquo;s Leap is most famous for, &ldquo;The Judgment of Paris.&rdquo; When in 1976, in a blind wine tasting event held in Paris, their Cabernet was judged the best overall. * The wine world was floored by this outcome. This instance in wine history really solidified California as a reputable wine market.</p>
						<p>This wine was from Napa Valley, California and sampled on February 6, 2017. I at first noted that the color was so deep that it was more purple than red. It smelled of blackberries and very rich plums. It was nice though. Not too heavy. With my first taste I smiled. I thought, this bit of earthiness fits New Orleans so well. You can smell the earth everywhere there. The low sea level and amount of rain the city receives lends to this and by itself, was the perfect pairing… Or so I thought until I tried the cheese. The smoky flavor in the smoked cheddar cheese fit just right with the rich fruit flavor in the cabernet. I was worried I would not be able to share with my husband! I also noted that this wine had a perfect smoothness to it. The acidity was low enough that I never tasted any bitterness.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 5.0 and even looking back at it now, I do not regret it or think it deserves any less than a perfect score. This wine brings back great memories and great tastes.</p>

						<h4 id="blog_2">Mont Gravet Carignan</h4>
						<p>March 10, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tut933x087xrd54/mont_gravet.jpg?raw=1"><br><br>
						<p>This week I pulled out the Mont Gravet Carignan from my Wine Awesomeness box. I wanted to try it first because the musical selection for this wine was, “You and I” by Ingrid Michaelson. I love me some Ingrid, so I was excited to try this wine.  The Carignan was a 2015 vintage from Pays d’Herault, France. I sampled this wine on January 27, 2017, and noted it’s beautiful <em>Red</em> color. I had not had much experience with French wines so I was quite intrigued by it.</p>
						<p>To start off, I did some research into Carignan grapes before beginning my tasting process. I found that it is a red wine grape varietal generally grown in Spain or France. This grape is both consistently late with both budding and ripening. * So just think of it as that friend who you always tell the event time is 15 minutes earlier than it actually is. It used to be the most common grape grown in France, but that honor was taken over by Merlot, and thus Carignan is less widely known now. *</p>
						<p>After swirling, I breathed in deep from my wine glass and smelled the scents of blueberries and cherries. I was surprised! I had been expecting an earthier smell. I turned on “You and I” and started the tasting process. The first thing I noted was the very smooth finish this wine had. It was just somewhat acidic, but in a way that left me wanting more. I could taste overripe cherries and this made my mouth water. I then tried the Swiss cheese suggested pairing and was happy with how well it seemed to even out the boldness of this wine.</p>
						<p>Overall, I gave this wine a rating of 3.5. It paired perfectly with a chilly night in and as the first wine in my Wine Awesomeness box I was very pleased.</p>

						<h4 id="sparkling moscato blog_1">The Start of a Journey</h4>
						<p>March 1, 2017</p>
						<img src="images/blog_1.jpg"><br><br>
						<p>With this first post, I want to officially begin my journey through the world of wine. While I’ve had an interest in wine for some time now, I would like to change direction and really start delving into what makes wine the most interesting and captivating drink throughout every society. There are not many things in this world that have the power to unite, divide, delight, or disappoint people. And wine has this magical ability across the globe. From California to Siberia, wine enriches so many lives. It is absolutely fascinating.</p>
						<p>I technically started my journey with wine at the age of 16, when my boyfriend’s father decided to let us try some of the wine he had bought that day for my boyfriend’s mother. It was a yellow tail merlot. I remember thinking how exotic it must be because of the kangaroo on the label. I associate kangaroos with Australia and I thought, “Wow! This must be very expensive wine to come all the way from Australia!” One sip, and I was immediately put off. I think I had expected it to taste like grape juice and when instead it tasted like dirty grape acid, I thought, “This isn’t for me.” My boyfriend had a similar reaction and his father laughed and told us it was an acquired taste.</p>
						<p>I was extremely disappointed in that moment. I wanted to be this sophisticated type of person who would someday be able to pick a wine that went perfectly with every meal. Instead, here I was pushing back the first glass of wine I’d ever had because I apparently had no taste for it.</p>
						<p>It took me quite a few years to even try wine again. My new husband took me out to a very nice dinner one evening in Nashville. We were handed a wine list and my husband suggested I try to pick out a wine since he wanted that night to be special. I thought to myself, “I should try wine again. It would be so great if I could pick a wine to go with our meals when we are out.” So I started scanning the wine list and I got to the sparkling section. I figured maybe these would be sweeter and for some reason, better. I selected a glass of the Umberto Fiori Moscato D’asti. The waiter looked at me kind of odd and asked if we were celebrating something. I said no and he nodded. I then knew I had made a weird choice, but what’s done is done, so we ordered our food and waited for it to appear.</p>
						<p>When my glass was brought to the table, I saw the light coloring and bubbles and was instantly attracted. I took a sip and fell instantly in love. I thought, “If some wine tastes like this, then I can do this whole wine thing!” I sipped again and again and what I thought of as the sweet nectar of the gods filled me with happiness and made the evening that much more memorable.</p>
						<p>From that night on I started trying wine more often. Eventually, I even ventured out of the sparkling section! Now I can proudly say that I withhold all prejudices when it comes to wine. If you have not tried it, then you don’t know if it’s good or bad and even if you have, there are some that should be tried more than once. Also, some wine tastes great to some drinkers and terrible to others. Sometimes, it really just depends on your taste buds.</p>
						<p>For 2017, I subscribed to a monthly wine subscription and I made a vow to start tracking the wines that I try in order to really further my wine education and hopefully kick it up a notch. I will be receiving three wines per month from the subscription, but I also might be purchasing a few extra bottles here and there, because really who can resist? Maybe in the end, I’ll become that sophisticated person that that 16-year-old girl really wanted to be. Maybe not. No promises. At least I will have gotten to try more wine!</p>
