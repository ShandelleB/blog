						<h4>Graef Chardonnay</h4>
						<p>September 20, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ohsnbre50mrxx1n/graef_chardonnay.jpg?raw=1" alt="Graef Chardonnay paired with Shrimp Fried Rice" title="Graef Chardonnay paired with Shrimp Fried Rice"><br><br>
						<p>I know I have had my fair share of Chardonnays. I think just about everyone has. Those golden hued bottles pull you to them in just the right way. Maybe just the golden color makes us feel a little richer. If you are looking for something familiar you can usually count on that oaky, buttery taste. However in recent years, the Chardonnay industry has been shaking it up a bit and it is proving to be quite the improvement according to wine lovers far and wide<a href="blogs.html#blog_25">...</a></p>
						<p>Chardonnay is the most popular white wine grape in the entire world and the fifth most widely planted grape. While the grape originates from France, it has seen its highest successes in California. While most drinkers associate Chardonnay with oaky and buttery flavors, now winemakers are opting to age it in stainless steel and are coming up with tremendous results. The grapes bring forth more crisp fruit and stony flavors, which are really trying to tell the tale of their terroir.*</p>
						<p>Chardonnay nearly fell off the rails just a few years ago. Maybe it was that it became too predictable. It could be that as people have turned more towards healthy and active lifestyles, a wine that tasted like vanilla and butter sat a little to heavy for them. Whatever the reason, this cultural shift has made winemakers change their methods when it comes to Chardonnay. While there are still plenty of buttery Chardonnays out there, they are now being passed over for the lighter colored, stainless steel aged ones, which is exactly what this weeks wine was.</p>
						<p>This wine was from Yountville, California, and sampled on August 4, 2017. Just barely dipping my nose into the glass brought forth a strong pineapple smell. A few more sniffs and I also found a bit of mango with just the tiniest bit of butter. The first taste just made me think &lsquo;crisp,&rsquo; like biting into an apple. I was listening to &ldquo;May I Have This Dance&rdquo; featuring Chance the Rapper by Francis & the Lights. A couple of more sips and I tasted a glass full of herbs and a little green tea. It turned out to be a great compliment to the shrimp fried cauliflower rice I had prepared.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 3.5. This was an entirely new Chardonnay experience for me and I was really enjoying it. This type of Chardonnay was much less heavy and could have been enjoyed alone even though it was a great compliment to my dish.</p>

						<h4>Glory Days – Van Ruiten Zinfandel</h4>
						<p>September 6, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/los8eeax9yyzfp8/glory_days_zinfandel.jpg?raw=1" alt="Glory Days Zinfandel paired with a Key Lime Cupcake" title="Glory Days Zinfandel paired with a Key Lime Cupcake"><br><br>
						<p>With a new box from Wine Awesomeness came a bottle from Van Ruiten Vineyards that was most intriguing. With it&rsquo;s adorable label, I just couldn&rsquo;t resist opening it first. A little station wagon with a surfboard, vintage-style font, and matching top and label made this wine really stand out.</p>
						<p>The information provided in the Wine Awesomeness booklet alluded to the story of Van Ruiten Vineyards, but I delved into my own research in order to understand the wine&rsquo;s story further. The Van Ruiten&rsquo;s were a Dutch family that moved to America right after World War II  and to Lodi, California specifically. With a dream of owning a vineyard, they purchased one with &ldquo;sweat equity&rdquo; in the 1950s. Today the family owns roughly 800 acres and harvests their grapes by hand each year.*</p>
						<p>I felt like Zinfandel as a varietal garnered a bad rep sometimes, so I wanted to do a bit of research on this grape varietal. I discovered that, while the grape probably arose from Croatia, the name &lsquo;Zinfandel&rsquo; is truly American and has been around since 1832. Zinfandel is now the third leading grape varietal in America. While Zinfandel is red, it is mostly used in making rosé.* So, while Zinfandel may have a reputation for being lesser, it is obviously a crowd pleaser.</p>
						<p>This wine was from Lodi, California, and sampled on July 21, 2017. This wine smelled woodsy, like a pinecone. It reminded me of men&rsquo;s cologne. There were also lingering scents of vanilla. There were definite tastes of candy apple brought in with the first sip. Of course, I was listening to &ldquo;Glory Days&rdquo; by Bruce Springsteen. The sweetness of the candy apple flavor became a bit too much after a few sips. Paired with a dark chocolate cupcake, the bitterness helped to balance out the sweetness a tiny bit.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 2.5. I really wanted to like this wine, but in the end it just was not happening for me. I wouldn&rsquo;t be planning on purchasing again, but I did not plan on letting it discourage me from trying more Zinfandel in the future.</p>

						<h4>Eikendal Vineyards Rosé</h4>
						<p>August 30, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jikffbr110yr2cb/eikendal_vineyards_rose.jpg?raw=1" alt="Eikendal Vineyards Rosé paired with BBQ" title="Eikendal Vineyards Rosé paired with BBQ"><br><br>
						<p>Being that it was mid-summer, I was more than a little excited to have a rosé on deck for this week. The heat was settling into Dallas fiercely and a rosé was just what I needed to quench my thirst and cool me down. I was also excited to try this particular rosé, because Wine Awesomeness was advertising it quite a bit and even allowing mid-day deliveries of it in Manhattan. To tell the truth, I was pretty jealous I did not live in Manhattan this week.</p>
						<p>After simply going through the Eikendal Vineyards website, I noticed how this vineyard was different than so many others. While the main focus of the company was on vines, the company had clearly tried to capitalize on its lands and product. There was a restaurant on site and several different tour options. They offered not just the usual winery tour, but actual experiences. From cellar tours to fly-fishing to vineyard walks there was more to do at this winery than any other I had come across. They also had an on-site restaurant, playground, and cheetah sanctuary.</p>
						<p>Eikendal Vineyards was even into giving back to their community. With a cheetah sanctuary and a sponsor of the &ldquo;Pebble Project,&rdquo; Eikendal Vineyards recognized that even vineyards have social responsibilities. The cheetah sanctuary promoted education and preservation of cheetahs and the Pebble Project acted as an educational program for children in need.* It was safe to say that so far in my personal wine journey, I had not encountered a winery quite like this, but I hoped to discover more in the future.</p>
						<p>This wine was from Western Cape, South Africa, and sampled on July 14, 2017. The wine smelled like papaya and frozen strawberries. It was chilled just right and my glass was quickly turning opaque in the heat. The color was the perfect pink shade for a rosé. The first thing I noticed was the mouth-puckering acidity. I was listening to “All My Friends” by LCD Soundsystem. The second sip brought forth a burst of lemon flavor. It was so refreshing that I didn’t want to put my glass down. I wondered if something could actually taste pink, but in the end I wished it had a tad more of a berry taste to it.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 4.5. It was a nearly perfect solution to a hot summer night. With a tad more berry taste it would have been perfect. Maybe I just needed the perfect food pairing though.</p>

						<h4 id="blog_22">Record Family Wines Merlot</h4>
						<p>August 23, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/odaj0kvhiq82f3e/record_merlot.jpg?raw=1" alt="Record Family Wines Merlot paired with Havarti, Gouda, and Berries" title="Record Family Wines Merlot paired with Havarti, Gouda, and Berries"><br><br>
						<p>It was time, yet again for another Out of the Box Week at my house. This week brought a familiar wine variety, a merlot. Pulled from the collection that my husband had procured, I selected this wine because I felt like having something familiar.</p>
						<p>As the second most popular grape in the world, it&rsquo;s safe to say that Merlot has quite the following. Only Cabernet Sauvignon is grown in a larger quantity.* Merlot is a highly approachable red wine. Its name is easy to pronounce and it generally pairs well with many different dishes. It also makes for easy drinking solo as well. It’s not too heavy and it generally doesn’t have any flavors that come forth that drinkers are not already predicting.</p>
						<p>While it originated as a blending grape, Merlot came to California and blossomed on it&rsquo;s own as a single varietal wine. Americans were quick to accept it and the single varietal style grew to be accepted worldwide.*</p>
						<p>This wine was from Paso Robles, California, and sampled on July 8, 2017. The first smell brought only dark plum scents forward, but continued sniffs brought out damp earth and floral hints. I was listening to &ldquo;Crash Into Me&rdquo; by Dave Matthews Band. The first taste was meaty and brought a juicy sensation to my mouth. So juicy! The Havarti and Gouda made the wine taste even meatier. However, it was still light enough on my palate to be enjoyable.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 4.0. This was a great example of merlot wine in general. It paired well with food, but could have easily stood alone. It definitely fulfilled my need for something familiar this week.</p>

						<h4 id="blog_21">Valdepalacios Crianza</h4>
						<p>August 9, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qs3rasdchcppal3/valdepalacios_crianza.jpg?raw=1" alt="Valdepalacios Crianza paired with Pulled Pork, Green Beans, and Salad" title="Valdepalacios Crianza paired with Pulled Pork, Green Beans, and Salad"><br><br>
						<p>A trip to Spain was in store with this week&rsquo;s wine, Rioja to be exact.  As with several previous weeks, Wine Awesomeness was sending me on a journey to a place I had never been before with a wine varietal I had never tried. Therefore, the research began.</p>
						<p>There are four main levels when it comes to Rioja wines. It starts with the Rioja level and then moves upward to Crianza, then Reserva, and finally Gran Reserva. In the case of this wine, a Crianza, I learned that these wine generally age in oak barrels for six months to a year and then in the bottle for another year. Crianzas are the most approachable wines from Rioja and generally provide a great value wine. *</p>
						<p>This particular Crianza was a blend of 85% Tempranillo, 10% Grenache, and 5% Mazuelo. While I had previous experience with Tempranillo and Grenache, I had yet to taste Mazuelo, or so I thought. What I discovered is that Mazuelo is another name for the grape Carignan and is generally used only as a grape for blending. *</p>
						<p>This wine was from Rioja, Spain and sampled on July 3, 2017. I took in the smell of earth with hints of raspberries and a little herb. There was definitely spiciness hiding just underneath the surface. The first taste was much more fruit-forward than I would have expected from the scents that had come forth. I was listening to &ldquo;Dancing in the Moonlight&rdquo; by Toploader. This wine kept things light just like the song. So berry fruity! :p It proved a perfect compliment to my pulled pork dinner.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 4.0. This wine seemed made for easy drinking. It paired well with food, but was smooth and enjoyable on it&rsquo;s own. It made me want to try more Cianzas.</p>

						<h4 id="blog_20">Hermann Moser Grüner Veltliner</h4>
						<p>August 2, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hbx5i8q6gamf2qp/hermann_moser_gruner_veltliner.jpg?raw=1" alt="Hermann Moser Grüner Veltliner paired with Spicy Pasta" title="Hermann Moser Grüner Veltliner paired with Spicy Pasta"><br><br>
						<p>This week marked what would be my second Austrian Grüner Veltliner wine. I noted how the bottles seemed so similar. Both were white wines with just a hint of green tint and this tint was accentuated by another white label with green designs.</p>
						<p>From my previous research, I learned that Grüner Veltliner pairs well with spicy food, so I prepared a spicy noodle dish to enjoy with this wine specifically. It combined sweet potato noodles with spicy sausage and a tomato-based sauce along with a few additional herbs and spices.</p>
						<p>The Hermann Moser winery is managed by a husband and wife duo that combines their love for life and each other with their love for wine. The winery is in the middle of a region that grows Riesling and Grüner Veltliner almost exclusively. Located near the Danube River, this body of water lends to the terroir of the area. *</p>
						<p>While, we&rsquo;re on the topic, let&rsquo;s discuss what terroir really is. It is basically how the elements that grapes are grown in affect the wine. There are four main elements of terroir, soil, terrain, climate, and tradition. Each element can add to or take away from the taste of a wine. *</p>
						<p>This wine was from Kremstal, Austria and sampled on June 23, 2017. Again I noted that familiar <em>green</em> tint. The first whiff brought to mind the word sparkly. I know that isn’t a scent but it&rsquo;s just what I thought of in that moment. After another sniff, I definitely took away scents of green pear. Ooh! The first taste came with a bite to it! There was also a little sour taste happening, like with Sour Skittles. I was listening to &rdquo;Tennessee Whiskey&ldquo; by Christ Stapleton. The more I drank, the more it became like a juicy lime. The high acidity may have been a bit too much with the spicy pasta. However, the more of the wine I had, the more my mouth watered for more.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 4.5. As soon as I finished the glass, I wanted more of it. I had to refrain from pouring another. My only reservation is that it didn&rsquo;t end up pairing well with my spicy pasta.</p>

						<h4 id="blog_19">Iconic Wine Secret Identity Rosé</h4>
						<p>July 26, 2017</p>

						<p>With summer now in full swing in Texas and temperatures rising to above 100°F, I was so happy to see a bottle of rosé in my box this month. Just looking at it made me feel a bit cooler already.</p>
						<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if there is something going on the industry that is trying to make a special push for rosé, but I know that I&rsquo;ve been seeing it everywhere recently. Now that summer has hit, store shelves seem dedicated to this varietal. It&rsquo;s light. It&rsquo;s fun. And most importantly, it&rsquo;s delicious! You can drink it alone or you can pack it up and take it to that summer BBQ you&rsquo;re headed off to. It will make a surprisingly perfect pairing with grilled meats of any sort.</p>
						<p>Iconic Wines is a small winery in California. Most of their wines are made in part with help from larger wineries, but what is interesting about them is the art on their labels.* They have this kind of pop art style that blends in with pin-up styled women. It makes for very distinctive label art that really stands out from other bottles.</p>
						<p>This wine was from Lodi, California and sampled on June 16, 2017. After noting the lovely pink color, I found the smell coming from my glass was delightful! Raspberry, strawberry, and grapefruit scents combined to make my mouth start watering. There was also a faint hint of ocean spray. I was listening to &ldquo;XO&rdquo; by Beyoncé. The taste really hit me. Wow! The jammy flavor really packed a punch! It&rsquo;s like sparkling raspberry jam. I paired this with sea salt dark chocolate and the salt really cut the sweetness. It was just enough to make the wine that much more delectable.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 4.5. I felt like it captured everything good about rosé. It would be good for day drinking or all day drinking.</p>

						<h4 id="blog_18">Zazou Minervois</h4>
						<p>July 19, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ypx2cqs8d68q8sg/zazou_minervois.jpg?raw=1" alt="Zazou Minervois paired with Dark Chocolate Sea Salt Caramel" title="Zazou Minervois paired with Dark Chocolate Sea Salt Caramel"><br><br>
						<p>Moving back to the Wine Awesomeness monthly box this week, meant trying another type of wine that I had never seen before. This time, it was a Minervois.</p>
						<p>I quickly discovered that Minervois is an appellation, the title given to a specifically styled product from a specific place or region, for red wines in western Languedoc France. Although the Minervois title is usually bestowed upon red wines, it also covers ros&eacute;s and white wines as well. This wine was made up of the most prominent varietals for the region. It was 60% Syrah, 30% Grenache, and 10% Mouvedre. *</p>
						<p>It was fairly difficult to find any information on the Zazou winery. The most that I could gather was that it was a small boutique winery in Languedoc, France. They have recently released two red blends and one white wine.</p>
						<p>This wine was from Languedoc-Roussillon, France and sampled on June 9, 2017. I noted the deep <em>red</em> color and then breathed in the scents of dark fruit and candy. A little bit of something earthy came through as well. I was listening to &ldquo;Yellow&rdquo; by Coldplay. The first taste produced a definite smoky flavor. There were also flavors of cherry and spice breaking through the smoke. I paired this with salted caramel dark chocolate. The chocolate seemed to taste even saltier after a sip of the wine and the wine turned a bit earthier after the chocolate. However, when all was said and done, the flavor ended up falling flat.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 2.0. Nothing really stood out about it to me. I would not search it out to purchase again. In the end, it fully captured the meaning of the word, &ldquo;Meh.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>July 12, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mq09h8lg479a3ul/murrietas_well.jpg?raw=1" alt="Murrieta&rsquo;s Well Red Blend paired with Goat Cheese Stuffed Peppers" title="Murrieta&rsquo;s Well Red Blend paired with Goat Cheese Stuffed Peppers"><br><br>
						<p>It was time for another &ldquo;Out of the Box&rdquo; week. This week, I was still sourcing my bottles from the haul that my husband had surprised me with and I chose a red blend from Livermore Valley.</p>
						<p>I had never heard of Livermore Valley before, so I started my research there. Livermore Valley is about 30 miles east of San Francisco, CA. It is one of California&rsquo;s oldest regions, with grapes first being planted there by Spanish missionaries in the 1760s. However, it wasn&rsquo;t until almost 100 years later that pioneers began planting there. Then in 1889, the valley earned the first international gold medal in America for wine at the Paris Exposition. Most of California&rsquo;s Chardonnays started in Livermore Valley and can trace their lineage to grapes first planted there. *</p>
						<p>The Murrieta&rsquo;s Well winery started in 1884 when a man name Louis Mel purchased the land and started planting vines. The property was later sold to Robert Wente, but it wasn&rsquo;t until 1990 that the Murrieta&rsquo;s Well label was created. *</p>
						<p>This wine was from Livermore Valley, California and sampled on May 12, 2017. I took a long breath and breathed in the scents of cherries and a mixture of spices. My first taste brought sweet fruits and a hint of softness. The softness is kind of difficult to explain. It was almost like the edible equivalent of silky fruit. It was not acidic at all. I paired this with goat cheese stuffed peppers. It alleviated the spiciness of the peppers while also cutting through some of the tang of the goat cheese, which I could truly appreciate.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 4.0. While I would not be pairing it with goat cheese stuffed peppers again any time soon, I was ready to pair it with something a little more mainstream just so I could enjoy it again.</p>

						<h4 id="blog_16">Shatter Grenache</h4>
						<p>July 5, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hf5bka8g9q6q32q/shatter_grenache.jpg?raw=1" alt="Shatter Grenache paired with Chili" title="Shatter Grenache paired with Chili"><br><br>
						<p>This week marked the end of the parade of Portuguese wines. I was ready to move on. We had also been having a cold few days so I had made a pot of chili and was ready to get down to work.</p>
						<p>This bottle of Grenache was gorgeous for starters. The label felt like a printed work of art and I know it sounds funny, but the chosen font appealed to me.</p>
						<p>I had never tried Grenache before so I started in on my research. There are three main types of Grenache wine, Spanish, French, and American. While Spanish and French wineries usually go with pure Grenache, American wineries will sometimes blend in Syrah in order to achieve a more balanced flavor profile. Spanish Grenaches can be quite high in alcohol content whereas French Grenaches are known to be lower. *</p>
						<p>The Shatter label produces only Grenache vines and is a fairly new label having only been around since 2012. The vines are located in Maury, an area of France known generally for sweet wines. *</p>
						<p>This Grenache was not supposed to be a sweet wine though, so I was interested to see what type of dry red wine would be coming from the same region.</p>
						<p>This wine was from Maury, France and sampled on May 5, 2017. My nose came alive with the very distinct scent of cherries. The first taste was loaded with acidity. I figured it might be high, but this was surprisingly so. The aftertaste produced a pleasant enough fruitiness with just a hint of something herbal that I could not quite put my finger on. I was listening to “Da Vinci” by Weezer. It did help to cut through some of the spice in my chili. After trying it with food, I realized that I would not want to have it again without food.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 2.5. It could not stand on it&rsquo;s own, but when paired with food it was okay. If you can appreciate label art though, then you can appreciate this wine.</p>

						<h4>Caves Velhas Cardeal Selected Harvest Red</h4>
						<p>June 28, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4jmmq3wbcdpg2hv/caves_velhas_cardeal.jpg?raw=1" alt="Caves Velhas Cardeal Selected Harvest Red paired with Pork Steak, Swiss Cheese, and Blackberries" title="Caves Velhas Cardeal Selected Harvest Red paired with Pork Steak, Swiss Cheese, and Blackberries"><br><br>
						<p>Well I can honestly say, that this week I had no idea what to expect from my last wine from Portugal. My first red was no good, but the second bottle, which was a white, turned out to be amazing. I was a little nervous about trying a second red, but I figured that an entire region would not be able to let me down twice right?</p>
						<p>This red was also made from a selection of Portuguese grapes. It was 35% Tinta-Roriz, 35% Alfrocheiro, and 30% Touriga-Nacional.</p>
						<p>I hoped that this would turn out to be one of the &ldquo;elegant reds&rdquo; that this area of Portugal was known for. I crossed my fingers and then sat down to get to business.</p>
						<p>This wine was from the Rio Maior, Portugal and sampled on April 28, 2017. This wine had a nice <em>red</em> color to it. Within the scents of this wine came an interesting black tea smell with a bit of plum. I found this very interesting and a bit surprising. I had never smelled tea in a wine before. The first taste brought very bold and jammy flavors. I was listening to “Ocean Eyes” by Billie Eilish. I paired this wine with pork steak and Swiss cheese. The cheese actually took down the boldness a notch. The smokiness of the pork steak also provided quite a nice compliment to the jamminess of the wine. It even brought out a subtle blackberry taste that I had not noted before.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 3.5. It was a solid wine on it&rsquo;s own and I think pairing it with the pork steak turned it into a very good wine.</p>

						<h4 id="blog_14">Caves Velhas Douro Branco</h4>
						<p>June 20, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zzhu2ninlwwnv2k/caves_velhas_douro_branco.jpg?raw=1" alt="Caves Velhas Douro Branco paired with Dark Chocolate" title="Caves Velhas Douro Branco paired with Dark Chocolate"><br><br>
						<p>This week continued the Portugese wine trend with a Douro Branco from the same winery as last week. Needless to say, after last week I did not have high hopes for this week, but I was excited to see a white after what felt like a recent parade of reds. With the weather getting warmer I was also craving a lighter wine.</p>
						<p>This white wine was also made from a mixture of three different grapes. It was 40% Viosinho, 30% Rabigato, and 30% Gouveio.</p>
						<p>Last week I discovered that the Dao region of Portugal is known for elegant reds. I began to wonder what would this white prove for me. Would it fall flat like its red predecessor or would it stand out in a more pleasant way?</p>
						<p>There was nothing left to do at this point that try it out!</p>
						<p>This wine was from Doura, Portugal and sampled on April 21, 2017. I was immediately pleased with the smell. It was very fruity and had delicious floral and citrus notes. The first taste was just a tad sour in the beginning, but it was quickly overtaken by a more juicy fruit flavor. It reminded me of eating Skittles and to me that was exciting and quite enjoyable. I was listening to &ldquo;Same Drugs&rdquo; by Chance the Rapper. The dark chocolate cut through the sour taste and made the fruity taste fade a bit. It was a nice pairing, but I would love to retry with something more substantial.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 4.5. This wine truly surprised me! I thoroughly enjoyed it and would love to have it again. It definitely woke me up to the changes in weather and made a nice transition-to-spring wine.</p><br>

						<h4 id="blog_13">Caves Velhas Vinho Tinto</h4>
						<p>June 14, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yqo0s41kmmwhj0c/caves_velhas_vinho_tinto.JPG?raw=1" alt="Caves Velhas Vinho Tinto paired with Gouda, Almonds, & Blackberries" title="Caves Velhas Vinho Tinto paired with Gouda, Almonds, & Blackberries"><br><br>
						<p>I received my next box from Wine Awesomeness this week and inside I found all Portuguese wines. I had never tried any Portuguese wines, so I was quite eager to get down to business on these.</p>
						<p>The first I chose from the box was the Caves Velhas Vinho Tinto. This red wine was made from a mixture of three different grapes. It was 35% Touriga-Nacional, 35% Tinta-Roriz, and 30% Touriga-Franca.</p>
						<p>After a little research, I discovered that Portugal is famous for Port. Which makes sense right? Port? Portugal? HaHa! Anyway… I went back to my Wine Awesomeness box to see if I had received a Port. I was sad to see that I had not. It turns out that the weather in the Douro region of Portugal is what allows for so much Port production. The grapes produced there are highly concentrated thanks to the hot and dry climate. * This wine came from the Dao region where Portugal is known for growing some of its most “elegant” reds. *</p>
						<p>Despite no Port coming in this months box, I was still ready to try out what I thought would be an elegant red wine.</p>
						<p>This wine was from Doura, Portugal and sampled on April 14, 2017. My first smell was very surprising! I smelled orange and citrus fruits. I did not expect that at all. I tilted my glass back just to make sure this wine was in fact red. The first taste made me think of rocks but in kind of a good way I guess, if that is possible. There were subtle hints of blackberry here and there as well. I was listening to “1985” by Bowling For Soup and the more I tasted this wine, the more I wanted to go back to 1985 to a time when I had never tried this wine before. It seemed to only get worse with each sip. The rock taste became more prominent and I eventually just gave up on it before finishing my glass.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 1.0. I definitely do not recommend it and I will never be seeking it out to purchase again. I have to say, after that; I was not looking forward to the rest of this Wine Awesomeness box.</p>

						<p>This week marked another week for an &ldquo;Out of the Box&rdquo; wine. This was a wine that my husband picked up for me while driving home from a business trip. He stopped at the famous Salt Lick BBQ in Driftwood, TX for lunch and saw that they had set up a cellar shop next door. Since, my husband knows me well, he knew he would have to pick me up a bottle.</p>
						<p>I knew that tempranillo grapes were popular for growing in Texas, but I was not exactly sure why. The research ensued!  As it turns out, Texas is not the only place that grows quite a bit of Tempranillo. Spain is also a large producer of tempranillo.*</p>
						<p>But I wanted to focus on Texas Tempranillo for this post. The first winery to grow tempranillo grapes in Texas was Alamosa Wine Cellars. Tempranillo vines are thriving in Texas because they can withstand the heat. The vines are thick and so are the grape skins.* Now several other wineries are following Alamosa&rsquo;s lead and growing their own tempranillo vines. This varietal is quickly becoming a landmark of the state of Texas. While Cabernet is still the most widely grown grape, Tempranillo is gaining ground fast.</p>
						<p>I have had a few Texas Tempranillos before and found them to be hit or miss for me. But I had high hopes for this one!</p>
						<p>This wine was from the Texas Hill Country and sampled on April 7, 2017. At first sniff, I smelled only spice. After a few more whiffs I was able to distinguish hints of leather and plum. The first sip produced a bit of cherry with a high acidity that then faded into dark grape. I was listening the “Chantaje” by Shakira. I paired this wine with a spicy sausage and a few jalapeno poppers. However, the wine did not cut the spice of the food. Instead the food seemed only to exaggerate the spiciness of the wine. It needed something different for balance instead. But as a Tempranillo being sold directly beside a famous BBQ joint, it should be fit to stand with spicy and smoky flavors.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 2.5. It&rsquo;s not a wine that would stand on it&rsquo;s own for solo drinking. It also didn&rsquo;t compliment the type of food it should have. Prepared with something different, it may have faired better.</p>

						<p>May 24, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/6sx1qs1hcom1zs4/exem_bordeaux.jpg?raw=1" alt="Exem Bordeaux Blanc paired with Roasted Lamb, Bacon Green Beans, and Cheesy Mashed Cauliflower" title="Exem Bordeaux Blanc paired with Roasted Lamb, Bacon Green Beans, and Cheesy Mashed Cauliflower"><br><br>
						<p>Wow! I knew this week was going to be special! My very first Bordeaux. The beautiful light green glass with the intricate filigree label made my mouth water before I even started pouring a glass. I was so excited that I could hardly contain myself.</p>
						<p>The color of this bottle got me thinking about the color of all wine bottles. Why were they green? As it turns out, the reason for these green bottles is to prevent oxidation. Oxidation is considered a wine fault and can end up making your wine taste more like vinegar. *</p>
						<p>Oxidation is basically adding oxygen to wine. This is a process that decanting allows for. So why do we purposefully decant if oxidation is bad for wine? While oxidation is sought after when using a decanter, it is only just before a wine is to be served. Some oxidation will allow a wine to open up, so that you can get the full experience for that wine.</p>
						<p>But what does oxygen, which is outside of the wine bottle have to do with the glass color? If the bottle is corked and sealed, then how would oxygen get in? It turns out that wine contains its own natural antioxidants that prevent oxidation. However, sunlight can break these down and then the wine loses its oxidation preventers. Tinted glass blocks sunlight, which is why green colored glass and also amber colored glass, is used in bottling. *</p>
						<p>After all this research, I was quite thirsty. So, I poured myself a slightly chilled glass and got down to business.</p>
						<p>This wine was from Bordeaux, France and sampled on March 31, 2017. I instantly caught a whiff of fruity deliciousness before I even began swirling the wine in my glass. After swirling and taking a few deep breaths, I likened the scents to papaya and flowers. I was instantly transported to a beach in the south of France. I could almost hear some waves as I listened to “Call on Me” by Starley. This wine was high in acidity, but it was in a mouthwatering way. It kind of woke my mouth up a little bit. I noted some green apple tastes, before trying it with my foods. The Gouda cut a bit of the acidity, but the smoked sausage had the opposite effect. This wine left me yearning for the beach, a plate of fruit, and a sunset.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 3.5. Looking back, I think I would raise the rating to a 4.0, because I still think about it from time to time and debate purchasing it on my own.</p>

						<p>May 17, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/x01pi1rb48hnyzm/prodigo_nero_davola.jpg?raw=1" alt="Prodigo Nero d'Avola paired with Pepperoni, Pepperjack Cheese, and Blackberries" title="Prodigo Nero d'Avola paired with Pepperoni, Pepperjack Cheese, and Blackberries"><br><br>
						<p>At first glance I fell in love with this bottle from Prodigo. At the time, I did not need to know that it was from Sicily or that it was made from the most important red wine grapes. * All I needed to know was that this dark tinted bottle and beautiful gold filigree was speaking to me.</p>
						<p>I found I had to pull myself away from that intriguing stamp that resembled a wax seal from the Middle Ages. This small touch was also decorated with gold filigree and seemed to look out at me just as I was looking in.</p>
						<p>Once I could stop staring long enough to do some research, I discovered that Nero d&rsquo;Avola means &ldquo;The Black Grape of Avola.&rdquo; * This refers simply to the color of the grapes as they are very dark. It has historically been used as a blending grape. It has not until recent years appeared on labels alone. *</p>
						<p>This wine was from Sicily, Italy and sampled on March 24, 2017.  I at first noted the deep <em>maroon</em> color and knew that these grapes must really be as dark as what their namesake implies to produce such a color. I took a long whiff and noted scents of dirt, raspberries, and then the tiniest hint of mint, which was quite a surprise to me! I was listening to &ldquo;Diamonds on the Inside&rdquo; by Ben Harper. At first, this wine gave me a quick taste of fruit, but it quickly transformed into spice. I paired this wine with pepperoni, blackberries, and Pepperjack cheese. The pepperoni brought out more of a fruit flavor. The blackberries made the wine seem even spicier. However, it was the Pepperjack that really got me. It revealed a smoky flavor that had barely registered with me before.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 3.5. It was a solid &lsquo;very good&rsquo; wine. I would purchase it on my own if only to impress others with the beautiful packaging.</p>

						<h4 id="blog_9">La Pinot Pinot Noir</h4>
						<p>May 3, 2017</p>

						<p>This week was an exciting one. I got a new box from Wine Awesomeness and inside I discovered that they had partnered with a winery in order to create their own wine. My first thought was this is either going to be very good or possibly very bad. Of course I had to try this one first, so I pulled it out and began my research.</p>
						<p>After some research, I found that Wine Awesomeness had made this wine in collaboration with Carrier Wines. * However, all I could really find on Carrier Wines was a Facebook page with a link to website that did not work. It said that this wine was to honor racing pigeons. * I would have liked to learn more about what wine and pigeons have to do with one another, but I could not find much to go off of.</p>
						<p>Wine Awesomeness also stated that the grapes for this wine come from The Caraccioli Brothers. Their vineyard is in the St. Lucia Highlands in California. Their grandfather started the vineyard and now the brothers are running it. * This gave me a bit more hope for this wine.</p>
						<p>This wine was from St. Lucia Highlands, California and sampled on March 18, 2017. As I swirled I noted the <em>red</em> color. I took a quick whiff and noted a smell quite spicy. I took a longer smell and noted that there was something smooth underneath, but I could not put my finger on it. My first taste was fruit-forward with dark plum flavors. The finish turned very earthy. I was listening to &ldquo;West Coast&rdquo; by Lana Del Ray and it made me think of California where these grapes were from. I then tried the wine paired with a chocolate covered coconut bar and it helped to balance the earthy tones somewhat. I would also like to note that this was the first wine I have ever tasted mushrooms in. It was interesting to experience, but I’m not a huge fan of mushrooms, so it was not for me.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 2.0. The first taste was tolerable, but the finish was too earthy. When something as light as coconut didn’t quite break through the earthiness, then I knew I would not be seeking out this wine for more.</p>

						<h4 id="blog_8">Balance Sauvignon Blanc</h4>
						<p>April 26, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yl112ih4iuhq3og/balance_sauvignon_blanc.jpg?raw=1" alt="Balance Sauvignon Blanc paired with Havarti, Almonds, and Blueberries" title="Balance Sauvignon Blanc paired with Havarti, Almonds, and Blueberries"><br><br>
						<p>I have to say, before trying this wine I definitely thought the logo for Balance Winery was absolutely adorable. A little elephant balancing on top of the winery? How cute!</p>
						<p>I looked into the winery online and found that they try to be the best wine they can for people with a budget. Their wines have won several awards from the &ldquo;Ultra Value Wine Awards.&rdquo; * I have to say; this did make me a little nervous. I thought maybe these awards are not really real and this is going to be a rough tasting night. But, with such an adorable logo, I really couldn&rsquo;t resist.</p>
						<p>This wine was from Western Cape, South Africa and sampled on March 11, 2017. Maybe it was the nearness of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, but I could swear this wine had a hint of green to it. I swirled the lovely color around and then breathed in the scent of crisp pear. It was very light and pleasing to my nose. I was listening to &ldquo;Dancing on Glass&rdquo; by St. Lucia and could easily see this color of wine being a stained glass color. My first taste was very juicy, but also light. It made me think this wine would be great for drinking on a patio in the sun. I tried some almonds and then another sip and I found the nuttiness of the almonds was a great compliment. However, this wine could stand so well alone.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 4.0. I learned why Balance won so many awards for their wine. I think they definitely earned them!</p>

						<h4 id="blog_7">Cellar el Masroig Vi Novell</h4>
						<p>April 19, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/l2zuo8t1jrik0da/vi_novell.jpg?raw=1" alt="Cellar el Masroig Vi Novell paired with Summer Sausage and Smoked Cheddar" title="Cellar el Masroig Vi Novell paired with Summer Sausage and Smoked Cheddar"><br><br>
						<p>I have tried a few Spanish wines in the past and I found them to be about average. I was hoping this week would change my mind, as I would be trying a red blend from Monsant, Spain.</p>
						<p>Vi Novell is Catalan for “New Wine” and is released in celebration of San Marti on November 11th. This wine blends Grenache, Carignan, and Syrah. *  As the story of San Marti goes, he was living as a soldier and one night he came across a beggar with no clothing. He cut his own cloak in half and wrapped the beggar in it to protect him from the cold. While sleeping that night he had a vision of Christ insinuating that the beggar Martin had clothed had been Christ himself. San Martin is the patron saint of the poor, soldiers, conscientious objectors, tailors, and (most importantly for our purposes) winemakers. *</p>
						<p>After reading the celebratory story of this wine, I was ready to try it out and have my own little mini-celebration. And really, what is a celebration without wine?</p>
						<p>This wine was from Montsant, Spain and sampled on March 3, 2017. I swirled the lovely <em>red</em> wine around in its glass before inhaling and breathing in scents of smoke. It was an almost meaty scent and it made me think of roasting something over an open fire. The first taste was very bold and full-bodied with a bit of a berry taste. I was listening to &ldquo;Why Can&rsquo;t We Be Friends&rdquo; by WAR. I tried a bite of the pork sausage and was transported to an entirely new level with this wine! The saltiness opened up the wine and evened out the full body for a more enjoyable tasting experience.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 3.5. It was more of a 4.0 when paired with the sausage, but more of a 3.0 for taste alone, so I settled in the middle.</p>

						<p>April 12, 2017</p>

						<p>I was extra excited for this week. I would be trying my first Grüner Veltliner. A few days before I had read an article from Wine Folly * about this varietal and it really got me amped to try this wine. This would also be my first wine from Austria.</p>
						<p>I did a little research into the Pratsch winery before trying this wine, since I knew nothing about Austrian wines. I discovered that this particular winery was an organically certified winery and had been since the early 1990s. The main wine and most popular wine from the Pratsch winery is their Grüner Veltliner. *</p>
						<p>I thought this white would surely be a good way to end February and transition into March. Its leafy label and crystal-straw color made me thing of bright spring days and new buds on vines.</p>
						<p>This wine was from Niederösterreich, Austria and sampled on February 25, 2017. I took a deep inhale and smelled sweet green apple. However, I also smelled an acidic smell, which was a little off-putting. That high acidity really hits you on the first sip. I was listening to &ldquo;Ooh La&rdquo; by The Kooks, which made me laugh because I had a feeling this wine was a little kooky. Once I got over the acidity, I could taste a very bright citrus smell and also a slight grassy taste. After trying the pepper jack cheese I thought that the wine would cut some of the spice with the juiciness, but instead the acidity of the wine only intensified and added to the bite.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 2.0. I didn&rsquo;t thoroughly enjoy drinking, but it was tolerable. I would not seek it out to purchase on my own.</p>

						<p>This week marked the first week I would be trying a white wine since starting my blog and that had me quite excited. I do love red wine, but it was definitely time for a white. This wine would also be my first ever wine to try from New Zealand.</p>
						<p>Before I even opened the wine I wanted to take note of how gorgeous the bottle’s label was. The dark label really allowed the bright silver of the fish design to pop. It made me think of an island like New Zealand and I hoped to be transported there by my taste buds very soon.</p>
						<p>I felt that I was fairly familiar with Sauvignon Blanc, but since this journey is about discovery, I decided to do a little research anyway. I quickly learned that while Sauvignon Blanc is grown all over, it was originally New Zealand that started making it famous in the 1980s. It is known for it&rsquo;s bright fruitiness and is also sometimes referred to as Sancerre. *</p>
						<p>This wine was from New Zealand and sampled on February 17, 2017. After swirling, I inhaled scents of peach, mango, and then a hint of lime. This transported me straight to island time! Even though I was prepared for a fully juice taste, I was completely surprised by the sensation when I let it swirl around my tongue. It felt almost like I had bitten into a peach! At the same time I was reminded of tasting the honeysuckles that grew wild around the home I grew up in. I was listening to &ldquo;400 Lux&rdquo; by Lorde. Then I tried a bite of Havarti and it really brought out a delightful nutty flavor in the cheese. It was rather a delicious experience.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 3.5. Thinking back, that might have been a little low for this first white, but it is helping to set the standard for similar future wines.</p>

						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kkhs85engu7zms6/electric_red.jpg?raw=1" alt="Van Ruiten Electric Red Blend" title="Van Ruiten Electric Red Blend"><br><br>
						<p>This week was back to normal. After New Orleans, I was back to work and back in the swing of things. Which also means, I was back to wine from my Wine Awesomeness box.</p>
						<p>While we were in New Orleans, my husband just so happened to purchase a yellow electric guitar. This worked out perfectly for me, because this week was Electric Red Wine week, so I was excited to display the wine with the new guitar as you can tell from the photo.</p>
						<p>However, even though I was excited about the photo taking, I was not very excited about the wine. This wine was a &ldquo;Red Blend&rdquo; and I have not had much luck with those in the past. They have always seemed <em>too</em> … something. <em>Too</em> acidic or <em>too</em> fruity or <em>too</em> bitter. But, because I made a commitment not only to try a new wine every week, but also to not start off with a prejudice to any, I poured myself a glass and got down to business.</p>
						<p>After a little research into &ldquo;Red Blends,&rdquo; I discovered that more wine than I had ever imagined were, in all reality, red blends. And in California, wines only have to be made of 75&#37; of whatever grape they claim to be on the label. * So I may have been drinking more red blends than I ever thought possible.</p>
						<p>This wine was from Lodi, California and sampled on February 10, 2017. I instantly smelled cherries and it was delightful! For this wine, the song pairing was &ldquo;Light My Fire,&rdquo; by The Doors. This song really got me into more of an electric-type mood for drinking this wine. Woah!! With the first sip of this wine, I was absolutely floored! It was not what I was expecting at all. It had a full body with a delicious dark cherry taste and notes of plum and purple grapes coming through. I paired this wine with Feta cheese that had Mediterranean herbs in it, but this wine could easily stand alone. I also could have done without so many Mediterranean herbs. I resolved in the future to try it with Brie instead.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine another rating of 5.0. I could not believe it. Two weeks in a row, I tried two 5.0 wines! I’m not sure how next week is going to follow that!</p>

						<p>March 22, 2017</p>

						<p>This week was an interesting one. It was also an out of the box week, as I will call it from here on out. That means this wine did not come from my wine subscription box, but instead, was a wine that I went out and purchased on my own.</p>
						<p>It was a special week because it was spent in New Orleans, Louisiana. My husband and our dogs traveled there for the Rock and Roll Marathon. It was my husband’s first marathon to participate in and since it was in New Orleans, a city we both enjoy, we decided to stay a few days as well. He requested a celebratory wine to enjoy the evening after the marathon. Since he is a red only type of person, I chose the 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon from Stag&rsquo;s Leap Wine Cellars.</p>
						<p>Stag&rsquo;s Leap is a well-known California vineyard that was established in 1893. Stag&rsquo;s Leap is most famous for, &ldquo;The Judgment of Paris.&rdquo; When in 1976, in a blind wine tasting event held in Paris, their Cabernet was judged the best overall. * The wine world was floored by this outcome. This instance in wine history really solidified California as a reputable wine market.</p>
						<p>This wine was from Napa Valley, California and sampled on February 6, 2017. I at first noted that the color was so deep that it was more purple than red. It smelled of blackberries and very rich plums. It was nice though. Not too heavy. With my first taste I smiled. I thought, this bit of earthiness fits New Orleans so well. You can smell the earth everywhere there. The low sea level and amount of rain the city receives lends to this and by itself, was the perfect pairing… Or so I thought until I tried the cheese. The smoky flavor in the smoked cheddar cheese fit just right with the rich fruit flavor in the cabernet. I was worried I would not be able to share with my husband! I also noted that this wine had a perfect smoothness to it. The acidity was low enough that I never tasted any bitterness.</p>
						<p>I gave this wine a rating of 5.0 and even looking back at it now, I do not regret it or think it deserves any less than a perfect score. This wine brings back great memories and great tastes.</p>

						<h4 id="blog_2">Mont Gravet Carignan</h4>
						<p>March 10, 2017</p>
						<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tut933x087xrd54/mont_gravet.jpg?raw=1" alt="Mont Gravet Carignan paired with Swiss and almonds" title="Mont Gravet Carignan paired with Swiss and almonds"><br><br>
						<p>This week I pulled out the Mont Gravet Carignan from my Wine Awesomeness box. I wanted to try it first because the musical selection for this wine was, “You and I” by Ingrid Michaelson. I love me some Ingrid, so I was excited to try this wine.  The Carignan was a 2015 vintage from Pays d’Herault, France. I sampled this wine on January 27, 2017, and noted it’s beautiful <em>Red</em> color. I had not had much experience with French wines so I was quite intrigued by it.</p>
						<p>To start off, I did some research into Carignan grapes before beginning my tasting process. I found that it is a red wine grape varietal generally grown in Spain or France. This grape is both consistently late with both budding and ripening. * So just think of it as that friend who you always tell the event time is 15 minutes earlier than it actually is. It used to be the most common grape grown in France, but that honor was taken over by Merlot, and thus Carignan is less widely known now. *</p>
						<p>After swirling, I breathed in deep from my wine glass and smelled the scents of blueberries and cherries. I was surprised! I had been expecting an earthier smell. I turned on “You and I” and started the tasting process. The first thing I noted was the very smooth finish this wine had. It was just somewhat acidic, but in a way that left me wanting more. I could taste overripe cherries and this made my mouth water. I then tried the Swiss cheese suggested pairing and was happy with how well it seemed to even out the boldness of this wine.</p>
						<p>Overall, I gave this wine a rating of 3.5. It paired perfectly with a chilly night in and as the first wine in my Wine Awesomeness box I was very pleased.</p>

						<h4 id="blog_1">The Start of a Journey</h4>
						<p>March 1, 2017</p>
						<img src="images/blog_1.jpg"><br><br>
						<p>With this first post, I want to officially begin my journey through the world of wine. While I’ve had an interest in wine for some time now, I would like to change direction and really start delving into what makes wine the most interesting and captivating drink throughout every society. There are not many things in this world that have the power to unite, divide, delight, or disappoint people. And wine has this magical ability across the globe. From California to Siberia, wine enriches so many lives. It is absolutely fascinating.</p>
						<p>I technically started my journey with wine at the age of 16, when my boyfriend’s father decided to let us try some of the wine he had bought that day for my boyfriend’s mother. It was a yellow tail merlot. I remember thinking how exotic it must be because of the kangaroo on the label. I associate kangaroos with Australia and I thought, “Wow! This must be very expensive wine to come all the way from Australia!” One sip, and I was immediately put off. I think I had expected it to taste like grape juice and when instead it tasted like dirty grape acid, I thought, “This isn’t for me.” My boyfriend had a similar reaction and his father laughed and told us it was an acquired taste.</p>
						<p>I was extremely disappointed in that moment. I wanted to be this sophisticated type of person who would someday be able to pick a wine that went perfectly with every meal. Instead, here I was pushing back the first glass of wine I’d ever had because I apparently had no taste for it.</p>
						<p>It took me quite a few years to even try wine again. My new husband took me out to a very nice dinner one evening in Nashville. We were handed a wine list and my husband suggested I try to pick out a wine since he wanted that night to be special. I thought to myself, “I should try wine again. It would be so great if I could pick a wine to go with our meals when we are out.” So I started scanning the wine list and I got to the sparkling section. I figured maybe these would be sweeter and for some reason, better. I selected a glass of the Umberto Fiori Moscato D’asti. The waiter looked at me kind of odd and asked if we were celebrating something. I said no and he nodded. I then knew I had made a weird choice, but what’s done is done, so we ordered our food and waited for it to appear.</p>
						<p>When my glass was brought to the table, I saw the light coloring and bubbles and was instantly attracted. I took a sip and fell instantly in love. I thought, “If some wine tastes like this, then I can do this whole wine thing!” I sipped again and again and what I thought of as the sweet nectar of the gods filled me with happiness and made the evening that much more memorable.</p>
						<p>From that night on I started trying wine more often. Eventually, I even ventured out of the sparkling section! Now I can proudly say that I withhold all prejudices when it comes to wine. If you have not tried it, then you don’t know if it’s good or bad and even if you have, there are some that should be tried more than once. Also, some wine tastes great to some drinkers and terrible to others. Sometimes, it really just depends on your taste buds.</p>
						<p>For 2017, I subscribed to a monthly wine subscription and I made a vow to start tracking the wines that I try in order to really further my wine education and hopefully kick it up a notch. I will be receiving three wines per month from the subscription, but I also might be purchasing a few extra bottles here and there, because really who can resist? Maybe in the end, I’ll become that sophisticated person that that 16-year-old girl really wanted to be. Maybe not. No promises. At least I will have gotten to try more wine!</p>
